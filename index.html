            <h1>Hi, I'm Ehsan Zibaei!</h1>

            <p>
              I'm originally from the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz" target="_blank">Tabriz, Iran</a>, where my passion for engineering began. I pursued this passion by earning my BSc and MSc degrees in Aerospace Engineering from 
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology" target="_blank">Sharif University of Technology</a> and
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tehran" target="_blank">University of Tehran</a>.
            </p>

              In 2017, I embarked on an exciting journey to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" target="_blank">Munich, Germany</a>, joining the <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sse/homepage/" target="_blank">Chair of Software and Systems Engineering</a> at the
              Technical University of Munich as a research and teaching assistant, a role I enjoyed until 2023. Afterwards, from 2023 to 2024, I continued my adventure in Munich as an R&D software engineer at Elektrobit Automotive GmbH.

                My professional enthusiasm centers around robotics and AI, particularly focusing on motion planning and control solutions.   In the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> section, you can explore some of my endeavors, mostly regarding quadrotor aerial robots.
