          <h1>Hi, I'm Ehsan Zibaei!</h1>

          <p>
            I'm originally from the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabriz" target="_blank">Tabriz, Iran</a>, where my passion for engineering began. I pursued this passion by earning my BSc and MSc degrees in Aerospace Engineering from
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_University_of_Technology" target="_blank">Sharif University of Technology</a> (2013) and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tehran" target="_blank">University of Tehran</a> (2015).
          </p>
          
          <p>
            From 2017 to 2023, I worked as a full-time researcher at the <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sse/homepage/" target="_blank">Chair of Software and Systems Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich</a>. Afterwards, from 2023 to 2024, I worked as a Control Systems Engineer at <a href="https://www.elektrobit.com/">Elektrobit Automotive GmbH</a>, a subsidiary of Continental AG.
          </p>
          

          <p>
            I'm passionate about robotics and AI, with a strong focus on motion planning and control systems. I enjoy developing intelligent solutions that bring autonomous systems to life.
