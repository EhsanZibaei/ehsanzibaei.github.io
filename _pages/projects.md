# My Robotic Projects
<p>
  From 2013 to 2016, I worked as a part-time student at the Guidance, Control, and Navigation Lab, focusing on setting up robotic experiments and researching path-planning algorithms for quadrotors.

  From 2017 to 2023, I worked as a full-time researcher at the <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sse/homepage/" target="_blank">Chair of Software and Systems Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">Technical University of Munich</a>. My work focused on developing AI-driven tools and methodologies for root cause analysis of quadrotor failures, helping to enhance system reliability and fault diagnostics.

<p>
  From 2023 to 2024, I worked as a Control Systems Engineer at <a href="https://www.elektrobit.com/">Elektrobit Automotive GmbH</a>, where I developed positioning algorithms for quadrotors by fusing radar point cloud and IMU data. This work contributed to improving the accuracy and robustness of autonomous navigation systems.

<p>
  In 2024, I initiated a personal project aimed at improving task and path planning for robotic arms using emerging VLMs and LLMs. This is an ongoing project, and I will publish a summary soon.
