# My Robotic Projects

<section class="project-period">
  <h2>2013 – 2016: Guidance, Control, and Navigation Lab</h2>
  <p>
    I worked part-time as a student assistant, setting up robotic experiments and researching path-planning algorithms for quadrotors.

  <h2>2017 – 2023: Technical University of Munich</h2>
  <p>
    As a full-time researcher at the 
    <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/sse/homepage/" target="_blank">Chair of Software and Systems Engineering</a>, I developed AI-driven tools for diagnosing quadrotor failures and enhancing system reliability.
